**Cleargraph** is a multi-purpose GraphQL runtime for decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets. Its API is infrastructure that makes it easy for application developers to create products and services that take advantage of the Ethereum blockchain without sacrificing usability, flexibility, or security. Cleargraph is the essential missing link between conventional application development and on-chain smart contracts.
